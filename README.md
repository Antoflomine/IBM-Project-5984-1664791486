Web Phishing Detection

Phishing websites is a problem on internet that target the people amenabilities rather than software vulnerabilities. It can be described as it is the process of
collecting sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. Types of web pages are different in terms of their features. Phishing occurs when a malicious site
acts as a legitimate for obtaining sensitive information such as passwords, account information, or credit card numbers. Phishing attacks can be prevented by detecting
websites and notifying users to detect phishing websites. Machine learning algorithms have been one of the most effective techniques for detecting phishing websites.
